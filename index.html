    <h1>Just for Fun. <span class="mobile-no-break">No, Really.</span></h1>
    <p><em class="highlight">We like to write software!</em> Coding is a zigzag journey of problem-solving,
    and the destination is less important than some might think.</p>
    <p>We often get asked questions like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Why are you doing this?”</li>
      <li>“What is the purpose of this project?”</li>
      <li>“What does this project do better than <strong>X</strong>?”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Silicon Valley Cutthroat</h2>
    <p>If one spends a lot of time on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>, or other
    startup-oriented news sites, they might believe that everyone is working on their next
    multi-million-dollar startup and/or exit strategy. It may be hard to imagine that people work
    on open source code purely for the fun of it.</p>
    <p><strong>There are hackers</strong> who just love <em class="highlight">the art of building software</em>.
    They do it for the challenge, for the fun of it. They aren’t trying to make a million dollars.</p>

    <h2>Consumer Culture</h2>
    <p>Or, if one is used to <em>consuming</em> other software only, and rarely
    creating any, they might get stuck in a mindset of thinking “what can this project do for me?”
    (And if the project isn’t relevant to them, they wonder why it exists.)</p>
    <p><strong>There are hackers</strong> who don’t need lots of people to consume their software.
    Of course, they would love it if others enjoyed/admired/appreciated their work, but that's not
    strictly necessary. <em class="highlight">It's just fun to create.</em></p>

    <h2>We do it just for the fun of it. No, really.</h2>
    <p>Lastly, if one has learned enough programming technique to do their day job and not a lot
    more, then they might not appreciate programmers who are always trying new things.</p>
    <p><strong>There are hackers</strong> who live and breathe code, and the idea that every line
    of code must prove its monetary value, that every hour spent toiling away at the keyboard
    must be accounted for, is a damn shame.
    <p><em class="highlight">The process itself, flaws and all, has value</em>&mdash;not just the
    final product.</p>
    <p>I'll end with my favorite quote about programming:</p>
    <blockquote>
      The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff.
      He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination.
      Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable
      of realizing grand conceptual structures....
      Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves
      and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself.
    </blockquote>
    <div class="attribution">&mdash;Fred Brooks, <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em></div>

    <h2>Try it!</h2>
    <p>If you, dear reader, think you may have lost your way&mdash;that coding used to be fun
    for you, but now it's just a slog of clocking in and out to get a paycheck,
    then allow us to invite you back!</p>
    <p>Or, if you were conditioned to think that wild-idea programming is only for professionals
    and academics, this page is for you. You have the right to tinker, and have fun doing it!</p>
    <p>Think of something that you might like to build, learn, experience inside the computer,
    and just jump in. Without looking or researching first.
    <em class="highlight">You might just have a bit of fun. No, really.</em></p>

    <h2>The Club</h2>
